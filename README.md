## Inspiration üåü
A group of members in our local community struggled to find ways to commute to colleges from a nearby town 20 miles away. The distress from having to rely on ridiculously expensive ride booking apps and busy family members is daunting. That's why we created an eco-friendly rideshare app, exclusive to college students with our safe and secure authentication system, helping them find not only a carpool to school, but also long lasting friends along the way.

## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è
Carpool Native connects users with similar origins and destinations and shows lists of suggested rides. 
- Ride page for submitting a ride, when and where you need to be, using an interactive location query and map system.
- Messages page for communicating with other ride share members and getting to know carpool buddies.
- Ratings feature, you can see user's past reviews and ratings, you can also give your carpool buddies ratings too. 
- Profile page to see your current ride submissions.
